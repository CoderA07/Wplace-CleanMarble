Clean Marble ✨
Took Blue Marble, gave it a good polish, and stuck the UI to the side. It's cleaner this way.

A simplified and polished template overlay for wplace.live. This is a remix of the original Blue Marble userscript, featuring a cleaner interface with a side-button instead of a floating panel.
